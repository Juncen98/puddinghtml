Café Townsend’s visionary chef and founder leads the way in a culinary revolution. Proclaimed by many to be the best chef in the world today, Chef Ipsum blends earthy seasonal flavors and bold ingredients to create exquisite contemporary cuisine. 

The name Café Townsend comes from our first restaurant, located in a historic building on Townsend Street in San Francisco, where we opened the doors in 1992. We’ve replicated the elegant interior, exceptional service, and world class cuisine in our restaurants around the country.
