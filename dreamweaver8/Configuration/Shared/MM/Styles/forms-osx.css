/* Copyright 2002 Macromedia, Inc. All rights reserved.   This style sheet is used to tighten the formatting    on Dreamweaver HTML/JavaScript dialogs. It was created   specifically to address clipping issues that surfaced   when some enhancements were made to the dialog rendered.    Unfortunately, for dialogs that have many controls such    as the tag editors for <cfschedule>, the enhancements    to the OSX renderer made some controls disappear.       By including this style, which overrides the spacing of    of form controls including buttons, checkboxes, text boxes,    select lists, images and textareas, the dialog will be    rendered more tightly so that controls are not clipped.       In most cases, it is not required to include this .css file   in with your dialogs. If you do include this file, it's    important that you conditionally check to make sure that    the Dreamweaver platform is set to be OSX. Including this   style sheet for an HTML/JavaScript dialog on Windows will    cause the dialog not to be rendered correctly. This style    sheet is only design to fix OSX dialogs that contain so    many controls that some of them are clipped.       See the /configuration/taglibraries/cfml/cfselect.htm for    an example of how this file is used and how to conditionally   check for platform. */ input[type=checkbox] {   margin-top: -6px;   margin-bottom: -6px; } input[type=text] {   margin-top: -6px;   margin-bottom: -6px; } input[type=button] {   margin-top: -6px;   margin-bottom: -6px; } select {   margin-top: -6px;   margin-bottom: -6px; } textarea {   margin-top: -6px;   margin-bottom: -6px; } img {   margin-top: -6px;   margin-bottom: -6px; }
