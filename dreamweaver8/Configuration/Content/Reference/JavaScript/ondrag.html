As long as the user keeps the mouse button down following aninitial drag action, the <span class="literal">ondrag</span> event keepsfiring. Other drag-related events fire on other elements along theway (events such as <span class="literal">ondragenter</span> for an elementthat finds the dragged cursor in its airspace), but the<span class="literal">ondrag</span> event also fires at various instances.</p>							</td>						</tr>				<tr>

						<tr>							<td colspan="2"><p>			An element with content that is dragged receives events in thefollowing sequence: <span class="literal">ondragstart</span>,<span class="literal">ondrag</span> (perhaps many times), and<span class="literal">ondragend</span>. Elements in the path of the drag actionreceive <span class="literal">ondragenter</span>,<span class="literal">ondragover</span>, and <span class="literal">ondragleave</span>events, while the element at the end of the drag receives the<span class="literal">ondrop</span> event (which fires before the<span class="literal">ondragend</span> event of the dragged element). The speedof the drag action and client system speed impacts the number ofevent firings of all drag types. A fast drag on a slow machine mayresult in some events not firing.</p>							</td>				</tr>
