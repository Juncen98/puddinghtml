Note that in Netscape 6, mouseevents can fire on child text nodes of container-type elements,meaning that the <span class="literal">event</span> object's<span class="literal">target</span> property references the node, rather thanthe element. See Chapter 6 for details about theimpact of this W3C DOM-endorsed behavior and cross-browser solutions.</p>							</td>				</tr>
