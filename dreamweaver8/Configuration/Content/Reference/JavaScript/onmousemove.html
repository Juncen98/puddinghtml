Note that in Netscape 6, mouse events can fire onchild text nodes of container-type elements, meaning that the eventobject's <span class="literal">target</span> propertyreferences the node, rather than the element. See Chapter 6 for details about the impact of this W3CDOM-endorsed behavior and cross-browser solutions.</p>							</td>				</tr>
