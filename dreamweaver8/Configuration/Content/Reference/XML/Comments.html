<p>Comments can appear anywhere in a document
or DTD, outside of other markup tags. XML parsers are not required to
preserve contents of comment blocks, so they should be used only to
store information that is not a part of your application. In reality,
most information you might consider storing in a comment block
probably should be made an official part of your XML application.
Rather than storing data that will be read and acted on by an
application in a comment, as is frequently done in HTML documents,
you should store it within the element structure of the actual XML
document. Enhancing the readability of a complex DTD or temporarily
disabling blocks of markup are effective uses of comments.</p>

<p>The character sequence <span class="LITERAL">--</span> cannot be included
within a comment block, except as part of the tag closing text.
Because comments cannot be nested, commenting out a comment block is
impossible.</p>
