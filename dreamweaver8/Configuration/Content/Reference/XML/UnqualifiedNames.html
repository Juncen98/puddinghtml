<p>An unqualified
name is an XML element or attribute name that is not associated with
a namespace. This could be because it has no namespace prefix and no
default namespace has been declared. All unprefixed attribute names
are unqualified because they are never automatically associated with
a default namespace. XML parsers that do not implement namespace
support (of which there are very few) or parsers that have been
configured to ignore namespaces will always return unqualified names
to their client applications. Two unqualified names are considered to
be the same if they are lexically identical.</p>
