                     The page contains scripts, applets or objects that
                     might have moving content. If this is the case, it is best to modify or
                     remove them.
                     	 
                  </p>
                  
               </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td colspan="2" class="clearseparation">&nbsp;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td colspan="2" class="clearseparation">&nbsp;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td valign="top" colspan="2" class="description"><b>How to check</b>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     Check if the object causes moving content that does not stop and that cannot be
                     stopped by the website visitor.
                     	 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     If so, modify the object so that no movement occurs, or so
                     that the movement occurs only a couple of times and then comes to 
                     rest. As a better choice, modify the object so that the website visitor can
                     decide to stop the movement.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
               </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td colspan="2" class="clearseparation">&nbsp;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td colspan="2" class="clearseparation">&nbsp;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td valign="top" colspan="2" class="description"><b>Issue Explanation</b><br>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     The object has moving content, and the user of the browser is in no way 
                     able to stop this behavior.
                     
                     	 
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     This behavior is very distracting to the eye, and will make
                     it very difficult to concentrate on the task of reading the
                     information on the page or filling in the form contained in the
                     page. 
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     The consequences will be even more significant on users that suffer
                     from cognitive disorders, as they will have a very hard time 
                     concentrating on the page content. Consider also users of screen
                     magnifiers who may read a small portion of the page that overlaps
                     with the moving part. In these cases, a large part of the magnified
                     screen will display a portion of the content that will move out of
                     sight or change. The user will need to continuously and accurately reposition the
                     screen magnifier by tracking the moving content, making it extremely
                     hard for these users to concentrate on the task at hand.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     Consider that, in a sense, everyone is cognitively disabled
                     when under stress. For example, when buying an e-ticket for a flight from a
                     kiosk in a very noisy and crowded airport, with a long line of
                     people waiting for the same kiosk, most people will be unable to
                     fully concentrate on the task. A moving element in the page will not
                     help the user to complete the purchase.
                     
                  </p>   
                  
                  <p>
                     Finally, consider that screen readers are unable to read moving text.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
               </td>
            </tr>
         </table>
