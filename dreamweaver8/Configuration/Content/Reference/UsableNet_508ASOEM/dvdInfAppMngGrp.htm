                     Ensure that text contained in the page is appropriately divided
                     into manageable groups (headings, list items, etc.).

                     Use all the possible means to split large blocks of text, form
                     controls, and links into smaller groups.
                     	 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p> For example, use OPTGROUP to group OPTION elements inside
                     a SELECT; group form controls 
                     with FIELDSET and LEGEND; use nested lists where appropriate; use
                     headings to structure documents, etc.

                     The reading pattern on the computer screen is very different than on
                     paper due to the difference in the physical properties of those two
                     supports, and the difference in the two tasks for the user.
                     	 
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     When a person reads a web page from a computer screen, the page is
                     actually scanned to determine its overall structure and sections of
                     content. Titles, headings, bold faced text, underlined links, or indented
                     items quickly catch the user's attention.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     Large blocks of text are read only after this scanning process ends,
                     and <strong>only if</strong> something in it has caught the user's
                     interest. 
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     In addition, assistive technologies often provide the means to
                     automatically group information and render this information
                     separately. For example, they render one frame at the time; they allow
                     the user to jump to a certain section (marked up with a header H1, H2,
                     ...); they render a hotspot (i.e. image map) as a group, etc. In this
                     way, a user of assistive technologies can take advantage of this division into
                     groups of content or navigation items.
