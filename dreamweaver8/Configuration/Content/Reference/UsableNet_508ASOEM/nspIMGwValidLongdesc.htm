                     Image has a LONGDESC attribute that is not valid for one of
                     the following reasons:
                     
                  </p>

                        It points to a non-existing local file or web resource
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     
                     <li>
                        It points to a non-HTML resource

                  </ul>
                  
               </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td colspan="2" class="clearseparation">&nbsp;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td colspan="2" class="clearseparation">&nbsp;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td valign="top" colspan="2" class="description"><b>How to fix</b>
                  
                  <p>
                     Make sure the link specified by the LONGDESC attribute is
                     working.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     Since not many browsers at the moment support the LONGDESC
                     attribute, you may also want to place a so-called D-link
                     near the image. A D-link is a normal textual link with
                     label "D" pointing to an HTML page providing a full image
                     description. Example: 
                     <pre>
    &lt;IMG src="chart.gif" alt="chart of beverages distribution"
    longdesc="chart.html"&gt;&lt;A href="chart.html"&gt;D&lt;/A&gt;
</pre>
                     </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     Placing a rich textual description such as a caption close
                     to the image is another viable solution. In such a case,
                     you will not need the LONGDESC attribute or the D-link.
                     
                  </p>
                  
               </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td colspan="2" class="clearseparation">&nbsp;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td colspan="2" class="clearseparation">&nbsp;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td valign="top" colspan="2" class="description"><b>Issue Explanation</b><br>
                  
                  <p>
                     The ALT attribute cannot be used to provide a full-length
                     description of the content of an image. Think of a diagram,
                     a histogram, a chart, or a product picture in an online
                     catalogue. To describe its content, you need more
                     flexibility.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     The LONGDESC attribute can be used to provide a long
                     description of the associated image. By including the
                     attribute LONGDESC="any_HTML_file" in your IMG tag, you can
                     link the image to the HTML file containing a formatted
                     description of the image. The long description (unlike the
                     ALT attribute) can contain HTML code, with links to other
                     resources, formatting instructions, and more.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     However, since not many browsers at the moment support the
                     LONGDESC attribute, you may also want to place a so-called
                     D-link near the image. A D-link is a normal textual link
                     with a label "D" pointing to an HTML page providing a full
                     image description. Example:
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <pre>
    &lt;IMG src="chart.gif" alt="chart of beverages distribution"
    longdesc="chart.html"&gt;&lt;A href="chart.html"&gt;D&lt;/A&gt;
</pre>
                  
                  <p>
                     Placing a rich textual description such as a caption close
                     to the image is another viable solution. In such a case,
                     you will not need the LONGDESC attribute or the D-link.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     Adding a good alternative description to images is very
                     important today because many users can't take advantage
                     of graphics. They include users of cellular phones, PDAs,
                     and browsers installed in cars.
