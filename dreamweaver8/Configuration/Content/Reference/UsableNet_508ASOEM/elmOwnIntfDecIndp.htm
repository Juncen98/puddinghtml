                     The page contains event handlers and/or objects (using
                     OBJECT, EMBED, APPLET tags) that should provide a user interface that
                     is device independent.

                  <p>
                     Make sure if the event handlers and/or objects offer a user interface, that the interface can
                     be operated with any possible input device.

                     RealVideo.

                     	  Examine these objects and determine whether the

                     	  operated by devices other than the mouse.

                     	  As a quick test, try to use all the features of the
                     	  page with the keyboard only (don't touch the mouse). Is it possible to
                     	  get to all the controls (links, buttons, etc.) and operate all of them?

                     Programmatic objects can have their own user interface that is not
                     directly implemented in HTML. If this user interface cannot be
                     operated (and perceived) with all the input and output devices that
                     can be used by disabled users, then the page is not accessible.
                     	 
                  </p>

                     As defined by W3C/WAI (see <strong>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0</strong>
                     [http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/wai-pageauth.html#gl-interim-accessibility#device-independent]
                     ), "device
                     independence" means that visitors must be able to interact with a
                     website using the supported input and output devices of their
                     choice and according to their needs. Input devices may include
                     pointing devices, keyboards, Braille devices, head wands,
                     microphones, and others. Output devices may include monitors,
                     speech synthesizers, and Braille devices.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     Note that "device-independent support" does not mean that
                     the browser must support every input or output device. It
                     should offer redundant input and output mechanisms for
                     those devices that are supported. For example, if a browser
                     supports keyboard and mouse input, users should be able to
                     interact with all features using either the keyboard or the
                     mouse.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     Device-independent access means that the visitor may interact
                     with the browser or document with a preferred input (or
                     output) device. For example, if a form control can only be
                     activated with a mouse or other pointing device, someone
                     using the page without sight, with voice input, or with a
                     keyboard will not be able to use the form. The form is an
                     example of device dependence, because its use would be
                     possible only through a mouse.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     Generally, pages that allow keyboard interaction are also
                     accessible through speech input or a command-line
                     interface.
