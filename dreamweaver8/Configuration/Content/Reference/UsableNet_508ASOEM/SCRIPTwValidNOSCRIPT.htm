                     SCRIPT element does not have an associated valid NOSCRIPT:

                     <li>
                        A NOSCRIPT should directly follow the SCRIPT element
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     
                     <li>
                        The content of the NOSCRIPT element should not be empty.
                        It can include any HTML instruction.
                        
                     </li>

                     Note that the 508 standard 
                     <strong>
                        does not
                        </strong>
                     require that all SCRIPTS be followed by corresponding
                     NOSCRIPTS (though it is a suggested technique in WAI WCAG
                     1.0). The 508 standard requires that when pages use
                     scripting languages to display content or to create
                     interface elements, the information provided by the script
                     should be identified with functional text that can be read
                     by assistive technology. 
                     <br>
                     There are two kinds of scripts that require special care
                     and using the NOSCRIPT tag may help:
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>
                        <strong>
                           Rollovers:
                           </strong>
                        If a script changes an image on the screen when the
                        user moves the cursor over the image, and the script does
                        not indicate (through text readable by a screen reader)
                        that it has changed the content of the page, the script
                        cannot be made accessible.
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     
                     <li>
                        <strong>
                           Keyboard unoperable scripts:
                           </strong>
                        If the event triggering the script cannot be activated
                        through the keyboard, then the script cannot be made
                        accessible
                        
                     </li>

               </td>
            </tr>

               <td valign="top" colspan="2" class="description"><b>How to check</b>
                  
                  <p>
                     Check that the information provided by the script can be
                     also provided by text that can be read by assistive
                     technology.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     The easiest way to check if a script is accessible is to
                     try to view the page with a browser where scripts and image
                     loading are temporarily disabled (consult the browser's
                     documentation to learn how to disable scripts and image
                     loading). 
                     <br>
                     Another approach is to use the page without the mouse (by
                     tabbing through elements and using only the keyboard). This
                     gives you an idea of the role actual played by the script
                     in the interaction.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     If not, consider adding a NOSCRIPT element to the SCRIPT.
                     It can contain any HTML tag. Its content should let people
                     that do not execute the script achieve the same effects as
                     those that do. In particular, they should be able to access
                     the same content and same interaction opportunities,
                     including links.
                     
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     One way to provide a text equivalent to a SCRIPT element is
                     with NOSCRIPT. The content of this element is rendered when
                     scripts are not enabled.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     The NOSCRIPT element allows authors to provide alternate
                     content when a script is not executed. The content of a
                     NOSCRIPT element should only be rendered by a script-aware
                     user agent in the following cases:
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>
                        The browser is configured not to evaluate scripts
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     
                     <li>
                        The browser doesn't support a scripting language invoked
                        by the script
                        
                     </li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     Users of screen readers and speaking browsers would not be
                     able to take advantage of scripts that affect the graphical
                     interface of a web page.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     Users not using a mouse or joystick would not be able to
                     take advantage of scripts that open windows, dialogs, or
                     menus.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     Note that there are many other cases where scripts cannot
                     be run by browsers, and there are going to be more and more
                     of these cases in the future. They include:
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>
                        PDAs and cellular phones unable to execute scripts
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     
                     <li>
                        Browsers in diverse operating systems (Windows, MacOS,
                        Linux) unable to execute scripts written in a given
                        language. For example, VBScripts will not run in Netscape
                        on Linux machines or PDAs
