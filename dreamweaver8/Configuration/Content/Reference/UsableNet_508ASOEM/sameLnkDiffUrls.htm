                     The page contains two or more links that have the same link label
                     but that point to different URLs.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     A link label is considered as the text equivalent of the link content
                     and link title. In other words, all the text contained within A and /A,
                     the ALT of images contained within A and /A and the value of the TITLE
                     attribute if specified.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
               </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td colspan="2" class="clearseparation">&nbsp;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td colspan="2" class="clearseparation">&nbsp;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td valign="top" colspan="2" class="description"><b>How to fix</b>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     Try to use different link labels for links leading to different
                     documents. Also whenever possible, it is best to use informative labels.<br>
                     If this is not possible, (for example when it is necessary repeat the
                     same link "Buy Online" for several products listed in the page), then
                     try distinguish the links by specifying a different value for the "title"
                     attribute of each A element.
                     
                  </p>
                  
               </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td colspan="2" class="clearseparation">&nbsp;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td colspan="2" class="clearseparation">&nbsp;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td valign="top" colspan="2" class="description"><b>Issue Explanation</b><br>
                  
                  <p>
                     Do not use the same link phrase more than once when the links point to
                     different URLs.  If more than one link on a page shares the same link
                     text, all of those links should point to the same resource. Such
                     consistency will help page design as well as accessibility.
                     
                     	 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     When the same link label re-occurs, there is an implication that the
                     link points to the same place. If it does not, users may be surprised
                     and disoriented. It is best to assume that many users are not very
                     familiar with the way in which the website functions, and therefore there
                     is a high risk that they get confused and perhaps leave the site.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     In addition, screen readers and reading browsers often allow the user
                     to render the list of links of the page in a different pop-up
                     window. Each link is shown out of its context. If two links have the
                     same label then the user would assume they lead to the same place. The
                     user might then be unable to reach a certain page or Online service.
