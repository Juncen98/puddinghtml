                     Auditory presentations must be accompanied by text
                     transcripts or textual equivalents of auditory events. When
                     these transcripts are presented synchronously with a video
                     presentation, they are called captions and are used by
                     people who cannot hear the audio track of the video
                     material.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     Some media formats such as QuickTime 3.0 and SMIL allow
                     captions and video descriptions to be added to the
                     multimedia clip. SAMI allows captions to be added.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     Until the format you are using supports alternative tracks,
                     two versions of the movie could be made available - one
                     with captions and descriptive video, and one without.
                     Technologies such as SMIL and SAMI allow separate
                     audio/visual files to be combined with text files through a
                     synchronization file to create captioned audio and movies.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     Some technologies also allow the user to choose from
                     multiple sets of captions to match their reading skills.
                     For more information see the SMIL 1.0 specification at
                     http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-smil-19980615/.
