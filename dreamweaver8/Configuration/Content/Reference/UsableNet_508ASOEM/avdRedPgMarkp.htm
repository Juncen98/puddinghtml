                     When this page is loaded by the browser, after a given amount of time
                     a new page is automatically loaded and displayed.
                     It is best to remove this behavior.
                     
                  </p>

            <tr>
               <td colspan="2" class="clearseparation">&nbsp;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td valign="top" colspan="2" class="description"><b>How to fix</b>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     Until browsers will allow users to turn off these automatically
                     updating features, do not use auto-refresh or auto-redirect.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     If auto redirect is needed, then implement it using the redirection
                     capabilities offered by the server and by allowing the user to
                     specify when to load the next page. This would not affect
                     accessibility of the pages because the page would change only as an
                     effect of the user explicitly (re)loading the page.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     If this is not possible, and the redirect
                     META tag is still required, then it is best to enrich the two pages with links that
                     connect them, in both directions. In this way, if the redirect is
                     too fast, the visitor at least has the ability to go back to the
                     previous page. If the redirect is too slow, the visitor has the
                     ability to move forward at will.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     Please notice that this solution, although more usable than the META
                     redirect alone, does not satisfy the current guideline/checkpoint.

                     Pages that are automatically updated may pose significant problems to
                     users who are disabled or use technology that hinders normal
                     interaction patterns.
                     
                  </p>

                     People with disabilities might not be able
                     to move quickly or accurately through the page content and navigation
                     items before it changes. Users without disabilities may also face problems if, for various reasons, they
                     are slow in reading the page; for example, if they use a very slow Internet
                     connection, or if they use a small screen that forces them to slow down
                     the reading pace.
                     
                  </p>
