                     The page contains a programmatic object such as a plug-in
                     or an applet that may require a specific plug-in for the
                     browser to interpret the page content.

                     Check that the object is accessible or that the page
                     contains a link to an equivalent object that is accessible.
                     You should also check that the page contains a link to a
                     resource where the plug-in can be downloaded.

                     Make sure the object is accessible or that the page
                     contains a link to an equivalent object that is accessible.
                     Also make sure the page contains a link to a resource where

                     Programmatic objects may change the presentation, content,
                     or navigation options of a page. Programmatic objects
                     include Java applets, Flash, ShockWave, RealAudio or
                     RealVideo files. Each of these objects must be accessible.
                     If this is not possible, then the page should contain links
                     to other, accessible versions of the objects. When
                     evaluating the accessibility of plug-ins, it may be useful
                     to refer to the Access Board's section 508 rule as it
                     applies to software, 36 C.F.R. 1194.21 (see
                     http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/508standards.htm). In
                     addition, if these objects require some specific plug-in
                     for the browser, the page should provide the means for the
                     user to get and install the plug-in.

                     In general, PDF documents can be created in several
                     different ways and each method has separate implications
                     for accessibility. Here are four methods:
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <ol>
                     
                     <li>
                        Scanning a document into PDF creates a so-called "PDF
                        Image Only" file that is essentially a graphic
                        representation of the document and, like a photograph
                        with no associated text, is generally unreadable by
                        screen-reader technology.
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     
                     <li>
                        Scanning a document into PDF and then running it through
                        OCR ("optical character recognition") technology converts
                        the text images into searchable text. Such documents must
                        be checked carefully for accuracy.
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     
                     <li>
                        Printing a file directly into PDF format converts the
                        electronic information into a digital representation of
                        the document that is somewhat readable by assistive
                        technology
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     
                     <li>
                        Writing a document inside Adobe Acrobat can also result
                        in a document that is somewhat readable by assistive
                        technology.
                        
                     </li>
                     
                  </ol>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     Web developers should try to use the last two methods of
                     creating PDF files and should avoid the first method
                     entirely. You should also test the accessibility of your
                     PDF documents using screen readers before posting them to
                     web sites. Adobe's accessibility site includes the latest
                     recommendations for making PDF files accessible (see
                     http://access.adobe.com/). Finally, you should be careful
                     that non-text content be accompanied by text descriptions
                     in the PDF files. Developers that choose to publish
                     web-based documents in PDF should simultaneously publish
                     the same documents in another, more accessible format, such
                     as HTML.
