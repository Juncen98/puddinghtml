                     The page has no valid TITLE.

                     To define the title of the page include the following HTML code
                     just below the <strong>HTML</strong> tag at the beginning of the document:
                     <pre>
&lt;HEAD&gt;
 &lt;TITLE&gt;
  Buy the best strawberries fields in the world
 &lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;
</pre> 
                     </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     With Dreamweaver this can be achieved in a more simple way: simply fill-in the
                     title box on top of the Editor window.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     Consider that titles, to be effective, have to satisfy the
                     following conditions:
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li> a title should be <strong>brief</strong> and
                        <strong>informative</strong></li> 
                     
                     <li> should not contain HTML tags</li>
                     
                     <li> should be defined only once in a document.</li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
               </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td colspan="2" class="clearseparation">&nbsp;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td colspan="2" class="clearseparation">&nbsp;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td valign="top" colspan="2" class="description"><b>Issue Explanation</b><br>
                  
                  <p>
                     The TITLE tag defines the document's title for:
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li> browser windows</li>
                     
                     <li> speaking browsers</li>
                     
                     <li> bookmark lists</li>
                     
                     <li> history lists</li>
                     
                     <li> search engine results lists</li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>
                     A poor, or missing, TITLE would make the page much more difficult to
                     locate and understand in any situation where the user is required to
                     identify a window, figure out the context, selecting an item from a
                     bookmark list or search results. <br>
                     This often occurs when using assistive technology, since the page
                     title is the first thing that is presented to the user and
                     should clarify the new context brought by the page.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     To be effective titles should be <strong>brief</strong> and
                     <strong>informative</strong> (i.e. adequately describe the page). <br>
                     Citing Nielsen, <strong>a page title needs to be a pearl of
                        clarity</strong>.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     Titles should not contain HTML tags, as they would not be interpreted
                     by browsers (and would clutter the meaningful part of the title).
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     Finally, a page should contain exactly one title: if more than one is
                     present only one of them will be considered by browsers.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     Consider also that often screen readers, when presenting the available
                     frames to the user, read the page TITLE of the framed pages (not only
                     the TITLE attribute of the FRAME element). Therefore, it is important for
                     page TITLEs of framed pages to be well defined and meaningful.
