                     The FRAME tag defined in the document does not have a valid
                     TITLE attribute.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     A TITLE attribute of a FRAME tag is valid if the following
                     conditions exist: it exists, it is not an empty string (""),
                     and it is nor a blank string (" ").
                     
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     Define a valid TITLE attribute for the FRAME tag.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     Title the frame to help frame identification and navigation
                     by describing concisely the frame's content and role on the
                     page.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     Since the TITLE attribute is not widely supported,
                     providing titles as normal text at the top of the contents
                     of each frame is sufficient for the purposes of 508 rule
                     1194.22(i).
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     As an alternative, use the same string for both the TITLE
                     and NAME attributes. For example, the Lynx textual browser
                     uses only the NAME attribute.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     A TITLE string value is valid if it meets the following
                     requirements:
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>
                        It does not contains any HTML tags
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     
                     <li>
                        It is not an empty string ("")

                        It is not a blank string (" ")

                     Frames are good for implementing complex navigational
                     structures. However, if not implemented correctly they may
                     become an obstacle for many users. Make sure your framed
                     page can be accessed by any user using any possible
                     technology in any possible context.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     A general user interface design guideline is "to provide
                     context and orientation information to help users
                     understand complex pages or elements."
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     For frames, this means that the TITLE attribute should be
                     defined because its value is the only thing non-graphical browsers
                     show. In fact, each frame will be shown independently for
                     the other ones, making it hard for the user to figure out
                     their relationship. Titles like, "content area" or
                     "navigationals" are much more informative than "left" or
                     "top-frame".
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     Providing contextual information about the relationships
                     between elements can be useful for all users. Complex
                     relationships between parts of a page may be difficult for
                     people with cognitive or visual disabilities to interpret.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     Cognitive disabilities do not refer only to people who are
                     mentally challenged, but also people who work under specific
                     adverse contexts, such as people using an e-ticketing
                     service in an airport hall, a speaking browser by phone in
                     a noisy environment, a PDA where a quick decision is
                     required, or a browser during a meeting where changing the
                     mental focus is difficult.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     Similarly, visually disabled people also include people who
                     forget their glasses at home, who use a poorly lit display
                     in a dark environment, or who use a speaking browser or
                     screen reader over a phone.
