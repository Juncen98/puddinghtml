                     The page includes a server-side image map. Verify that each
                     active region of the image map has a redundant textual
                     link.
                     
                  </p>

                     Make sure each active region of the image map is duplicated
                     as a redundant link in the page. You must inspect the
                     implementation of the image map on the server to determine
                     the URLs that are activated when the user clicks on any of
                     the active regions.

                     Server-side image maps pose big accessibility problems,
                     including:
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>
                        Server-side image maps require specific input devices
                        like the mouse, which may not be available to certain
                        users in certain contexts (such as users of cellular
                        phones or voice controlled browsers)
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     
                     <li>
                        Certain users in certain situations may not be able to
                        accurately click on the map (such as disabled persons or
                        persons walking, driving, or standing)
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     
                     <li>
                        The links specified by server-side image maps are hidden
                        in the server and cannot be manipulated by browsers in
                        any way, including any assistive technology. Therefore,
                        the browser cannot communicate any alternative links to
                        the user
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     
                     <li>
                        Server-side image maps are less efficient than their
                        client-side counterparts because an additional
                        interaction with the server is needed for each user click
                        
                     </li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     For these reasons, the use of server-side image maps is
                     highly discouraged. The only exception is for active
                     regions whose shape are so irregular that client-side image
                     maps cannot support them.
