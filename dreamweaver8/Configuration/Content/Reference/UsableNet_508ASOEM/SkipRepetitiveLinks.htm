                     If the page contains a set of navigational links placed at
                     standard positions (often across the top, bottom, or side
                     of a page), then a textual link should be present to allow
                     users of non-graphical browsers to skip those links and
                     move to the page content.
                     
                  </p>
                  
               </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td colspan="2" class="clearseparation">&nbsp;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td colspan="2" class="clearseparation">&nbsp;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td valign="top" colspan="2" class="description"><b>How to check</b>
                  
                  <p>
                     If the page has a standard set of navigational links placed
                     at a standard location, create a link that lets users skip
                     those links. The easiest method is to use a normal text
                     link such as "skip navigationals" that points to a named
                     anchor on the same page.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     A more effective method is to use a transparent GIF with an
                     appropriate ALT attribute as the link. For example:
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <pre>
   &lt;A href="#content"&gt;
     &lt;IMG alt="skip to page content" src="spacer.gif" width="1"
height="1"&gt;
   &lt;/A&gt;
</pre>
                  
                  <p>
                     Users with graphical browsers won't see the link, but it
                     would be seen and used by users with non-graphical
                     browsers.
                     
                  </p>
                  
               </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td colspan="2" class="clearseparation">&nbsp;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td colspan="2" class="clearseparation">&nbsp;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td valign="top" colspan="2" class="description"><b>Issue Explanation</b><br>
                  
                  <p>
                     Web designers often place a set of navigational links at a
                     standard location such as across the top, bottom, or side
                     of a page. If non-disabled visitors return to a web page or
                     site and know that they want to view the content of that
                     particular page instead of selecting a navigation link,
                     they may simply look past the links and begin reading the
                     desired text. For those who use screen readers or other
                     types of assistive technologies, however, it can be a
                     tedious and time-consuming chore to wait for the assistive
                     technology to work through and announce each of the links
                     before getting to the page content.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     To address this problem, include a mechanism allowing users
                     to skip repetitive navigational links.
                     
                  </p>
