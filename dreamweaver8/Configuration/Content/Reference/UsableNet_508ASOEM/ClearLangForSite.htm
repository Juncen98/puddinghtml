                     Consistent page layout, recognizable graphics, and easy to
                     understand language will benefit all users. In particular, they
                     help people with cognitive disabilities or who have
                     difficulty reading.

                     Using clear and simple language promotes effective
                     communication. Access to written information can be
                     difficult for people who have cognitive or learning
                     disabilities. Using clear and simple language also benefits
                     people those whose first language differs from your own,
                     including those people who communicate primarily in sign
                     language.

                     The following are some writing style suggestions to help
                     make the content of your site easier to read:
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>
                        Strive for clear and accurate headings and link
                        descriptions. For example, some users browse by jumping
                        from link to link and listening only to link text
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     
                     <li>
                        State the topic of the sentence or paragraph at the
                        beginning of the sentence or paragraph (a technique
                        called "front-loading"). This helps people who are
                        skimming visually as well as people who use speech
                        synthesizers
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     
                     <li>
                        Limit each paragraph to one main idea
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     
                     <li>
                        Avoid slang, jargon, and specialized meanings of familiar
                        words, unless defined within your document
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     
                     <li>
                        Favor words that are commonly used. For example, use
                        "begin" rather than "commence" or use "try" rather than
                        "endeavor"
                        
                     </li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     To help determine whether your document is easy to read,
                     consider using the Gunning-Fog reading measure, available
                     at
                     http://isu.indstate.edu/nelsons/asbe336/PowerPoint/fog-index.htm.
                     When fed a text, this algorithm generally produces a lower
                     score when content is easier to read. If you find your
                     score soaring into the teens (or higher!), you've lost most
                     of your audience in the dense fog.
