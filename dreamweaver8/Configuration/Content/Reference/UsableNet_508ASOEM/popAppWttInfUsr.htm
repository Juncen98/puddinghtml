                     The page contains a script, associated to the BODY tag that could
                     open a new window when the page is loaded by the browser (i.e. a
                     pop-up window). If this is the case, the page fails to satisfy the
                     checkpoint. 
                     	 
                  </p>

                     If opening new pop-up windows is a required behavior, add a "Close" button to the new window that
                     would close the new window.

                     When the browser opens a pop-up window the environment in which the
                     user is working changes. 
                     It changes because:
                     	 
                  </p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li> some features of the browser itself in the new window may change.  For example,
                        the browser's 
                        buttons may be hidden completely, the geometry and position of
                        the new window change, the new window is opened on top of the
                        old one, or, other times it is opened below;
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     <li> even if it is not disabled, the "Back" button of the browser does not
                        work, since in the new window there is no "URL history" (and no
                        previous URL).
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     <li> for pop-up windows the change is even worse, since they appear
                        without any explicit action from the user side (except for clicking on
                        a link or typing a URL).
                        
                     </li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>
                     These factors, possibly combined together, amplify the possible
                     difficulties experienced by visitors, especially those who are
                     disabled or use disabling technologies. For example, if the new
                     window is opened with the same size and position as the old one, on
                     top of the old one, it might appear to a visitor as the
                     <strong>same</strong> window. The visitor might interpret the fact
                     that the Back button does not work as a bug of the browser (and might
                     restart the browser) or a bug in the site (and might switch to another
                     one).
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     For visually impaired visitors it is even worse: screen readers might
                     not be able to notify the user that there is a new window. Screen magnifiers
                     users might have a very hard time in guessing that there is a new
                     window somewhere and  where the new window is placed.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     Therefore it is crucial that in general the visitor is told that a new
                     window is being opened. Obviously the visitor should be told that
                     <strong>before</strong> opening the window, which for pop-up windows
                     is not a viable solution.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     In all cases, the new window should contain a button that
                     leads the visitor back to the page that has opened the window (or
                     alternatively that closes it). These buttons will work also if the new
                     window has disabled the standard browser buttons.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
               </td>
            </tr>
         </table>
