                     The page uses scripts that may change the content or the navigation
                     options of the document. All of these scripts should change the page in such a
                     way that assistive technologies can recognize these
                     changes and appropriately notify can be given to the website
                     visitor.

               <td valign="top" colspan="2" class="description"><b>How to check</b>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     Check if the scripts used by this page do create new content or
                     navigation options. An easy way for testing this is to disable script
                     execution on the browser and use the page.
                     	 
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     If some scripts add new content or navigation options,
                     then it is best to find an alternative way to achieve the desired effects.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     For example, would a server-side script (and a form) achieve the same
                     effect? Is it possible to make the page show its entire content if the browser
                     does not support scripts (for example by defining several layers)?
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     If all the content is defined within layers, and the script is used to
                     make a layer appear only when certain conditions occur, then
                     browsers that do not support scripts will render all the layers in
                     the order in which they are defined in the HTML file. In this case,
                     it is best to ensure that this way of presenting the content is
                     effective enough (for example by providing appropriate context for
                     each of the layers).
                     
                  </p>

            </tr>

                  <p>
                     It is best to avoid using scripts to create new content or navigation
                     options. Visitors with browsers that do not support the scripts will
                     not get that content or those options.

                     Content developers must ensure that pages are accessible with scripts
                     turned off or in browsers that don't support scripts. 
                     
                     
                     <ul>
                        
                        <li>
                           Avoid creating content on the fly on the client. If a user's
                           browser does not handle scripts, no content will be generated or
                           displayed. However, this is different than displaying or hiding
                           already existing content by using a combination of style sheets
                           and scripting; if there is no script, then the content is always
                           shown. This also does not rule out generating pages on the fly on
                           the server-side and delivering them to the client. 
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>Avoid creating links that use "JavaScript" as the URI. If a
                           user is not using scripts, then they won't be able to link since
                           the browser can't create the link content. 
                        </li>
                        
                     </ul>
