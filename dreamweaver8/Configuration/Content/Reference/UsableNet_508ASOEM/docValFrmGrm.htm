                     Make sure that the page contains valid code. Use the Markup Validator,
                     the XML Validator or a CSS validator to check if there are problems
                     and to find viable solutions.

                     By using appropriate coding standards, it is possible to develop
                     documents that are guaranteed to be potentially (and eventually)
                     compatible with all types of Internet browsers and agents.
                     	 
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     In contrast, coding for a specific browser type and version,
                     May lead to documents that are unreadable as new versions of
                     that browser are developed, and as new browsers are used. Consider
                     that in addition to mainstream browsers, website visitors may also use
                     speaking browsers (e.g. Home Page Reader), text only browsers
                     (e.g. lynx), or mini browsers on PDAs and cell phones. In addition to
                     human visitors, the site may be visited by crawlers of search engines
                     and of more specialized information gathering agents. These will also
                     benefit from a document that is compliant with known standards.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     Using syntax validators will help to determine if there are
                     mistakes in the documents; mistakes that were inserted
                     inadvertently into the document that could lead to unexpected, and
                     sometimes undetected, accessibility issues.
