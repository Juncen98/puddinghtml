                     The page contains the BLINK tag, which is a non standard tag.
                     	 
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     Replace the BLINK tag with another formatting property that does not
                     require the text to appear and disappear with no control given to the
                     website visitor. 
                     	 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     Remember that the W3C (<strong>HTML Techniques for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0</strong>
                     [http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#style-text]
                     ) suggests
                     not to use BLINK and neither MARQUEE.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     If blinking effect is required, implement it using the css property 'text-decoration: blink'. In this way the end result will
                     be
                     the same, however:
                     
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li> the website visitor can choose to disable CSS processing by the
                        browser, and the blinking will stop;
                     </li>
                     
                     <li> A better option is to provide more than one CSS style file linked
                        to the page.  It is still possible for most of the properties to
                        remain the
                        same (in the all the files) except for the 'text-decoration: blink'. In
                        this way the visitor (using an up-to-date browser) can switch between
                        the style files and choose the 
                        one that does everything that is needed, except for the blinking.
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     <li> the HTML file will contain valid code and will be smaller (as the
                        blinking property will be written only once in the external style file).
                        
                     </li>
                     
                  </ul>    
                  
               </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td colspan="2" class="clearseparation">&nbsp;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td colspan="2" class="clearseparation">&nbsp;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td valign="top" colspan="2" class="description"><b>Issue Explanation</b><br>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     The BLINK tag will turn on and off its content. The user of
                     the browser will in no way be able to stop this on/off behavior. 
                     	 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     This blinking behavior is very distracting to the eye, and will make
                     it very difficult to concentrate on the task of reading the
                     information in the page or in filling in the form contained in the
                     page. 
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     The consequences will be even more significant on users that suffer
                     from cognitive disorders, as they will have a very hard time 
                     concentrating on the page content. Consider also users of screen
                     magnifiers who may read a small portion of the page that overlaps
                     with the blinking text. In these cases, a large part of the magnified
                     screen will blink; again making it very hard for these users to
                     concentrate on the task.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     Consider that, in a sense, everyone is cognitively disabled
                     when under stress. For example, when buying an e-ticket for a flight from a
                     kiosk in a very noisy and crowded airport, with a long line of
                     people waiting for the same kiosk, most people will be unable to
                     fully concentrate on the task. A blinking element in the page will not
                     help the user to complete the purchase.
                     
                  </p>
