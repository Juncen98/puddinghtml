                     Define a valid TITLE attribute for the IFRAME tag.

                     Title the frame to help frame identification and navigation
                     by describing concisely the frame's content and role in the
                     page.

                  <p>
                     Since the TITLE attribute is not widely supported,
                     providing titles as normal text at the top of the contents
                     of each frame is sufficient for the purposes of 508 rule
                     1194.22(i).

                     A TITLE string value is valid if it meets the following
                     requirements:
                     
                  </p>

                     Frames are good for implementing complex navigational
                     structures. However, in many cases this added complexity
                     may become an obstacle for many users. Make sure your
                     framed page can be accessed by any user using any possible
                     technology in any possible context.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     A general user interface design guideline is "to provide
                     context and orientation information to help users
                     understand complex pages or elements."
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     Providing contextual information about the relationships
                     between elements can be useful for all users. Complex
                     relationships between parts of a page may be difficult for
                     people with cognitive or visual disabilities to interpret.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     Cognitive disabilities does not refer only to people whom are
                     mentally challenged, but also people who work under specific
                     adverse contexts, such as people using an e-ticketing
                     service in an airport hall, a speaking browser by phone in
                     a noisy environment, a PDA where a quick decision is
                     required, or a browser during a meeting where changing the
                     mental focus is difficult.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     Similarly, visually disabled people also include people who
                     forget their glasses at home, who use a poorly lit display
                     in a dark environment, or who use a speaking browser or
                     screen reader over a phone.
                     
                  </p>
