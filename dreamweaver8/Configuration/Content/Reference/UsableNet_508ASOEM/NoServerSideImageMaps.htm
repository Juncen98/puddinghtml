                     The page includes a server-side image map. Verify that the
                     image map can be replaced by a more accessible client-side
                     image map.

                     Determine whether the server-side image map is really
                     needed. The only reason to use one is if you need to define
                     active regions that cannot be defined with available
                     shapes. If you must use one, you should at least provide
                     alternative ways such as textual links to reach the same
                     destination pages. (You must inspect the implementation of
                     the image map on the server to find out how active regions
                     are defined.)

                     Server-side image maps pose big accessibility problems,
                     including:
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>
                        Server-side image maps require specific input devices
                        like the mouse, which may not be available to certain
                        users in certain contexts (such as users of cellular
                        phones or voice controlled browsers)
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     
                     <li>
                        Certain users in certain situations may not be able to
                        accurately click on the map (such as disabled persons or
                        persons walking, driving, or standing)
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     
                     <li>
                        The links specified by server-side image maps are hidden
                        in the server and cannot be manipulated by browsers in
                        any way, including any assistive technology. Therefore,
                        the browser cannot communicate any alternative links to
                        the user
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     
                     <li>
                        Server-side image maps are less efficient than their
                        client-side counterparts because an additional
                        interaction with the server is needed for each user click
                        
                     </li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     For these reasons, the use of server-side image maps is
                     highly discouraged. The only exception is for active
                     regions whose shape are so irregular that client-side image
                     maps cannot support them.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     You can recognize a server-side image map with a browser by
                     pointing the mouse at the image. Mouse coordinates are
                     displayed by the browser as you move the mouse over the
                     image.
                     
                  </p>
