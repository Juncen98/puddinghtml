                     Script included in this document has a valid NOSCRIPT
                     element whose content should be equivalent to the script.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     A NOSCRIPT is valid if the following conditions apply: it
                     exists, it is close to the SCRIPT it refers to, and it is
                     not empty.
                     
                  </p>

                     Make sure the content of the current NOSCRIPT conveys the
                     same meaning of the associated SCRIPT.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     The content of NOSCRIPT should let people that do not
                     execute the script achieve the same effects as those that
                     do. In particular, they should be able to access the same
                     content and same interaction opportunities, including
                     links.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     NOSCRIPT can contain any HTML tag.

                  <p>
                     One way to provide a text equivalent to a SCRIPT element is
                     with NOSCRIPT. The content of this element is rendered when
                     scripts are not enabled.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     The NOSCRIPT element allows authors to provide alternate
                     content when a script is not executed. The content of a
                     NOSCRIPT element should only be rendered by a script-aware
                     user agent in the following cases:
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>
                        The browser is configured not to evaluate scripts
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     
                     <li>
                        The browser doesn't support a scripting language invoked
                        by the script
                        
                     </li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     Users of screen readers and speaking browsers would not be
                     able to take advantage of scripts that affect the graphical
                     interface of a web page.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     Users not using a mouse or joystick would not be able to
                     take advantage of scripts that open windows, dialogs, and
                     menus.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     Note that there are also many other cases where scripts
                     cannot be run by browsers, and there are going to be more
                     and more cases in the future. They include:
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>
                        PDAs and cellular phones that are unable to execute
                        scripts
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     
                     <li>
                        Browsers in diverse operating systems (such as Windows,
                        MacOS, Linux) unable to execute scripts written in a
                        given language. For example, VBScripts will not run on
                        Netscape on Linux machines
                        
                     </li>

                        Users of graphical browsers who disable Javascript for
                        security reasons
