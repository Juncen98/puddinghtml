                     The page contains objects (scripts, applets, HTML objects)
                     that might cause blinking on the screen. If this is the case, it is best to
                     modify or remove them.

            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td colspan="2" class="clearseparation">&nbsp;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td valign="top" colspan="2" class="description"><b>How to check</b>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                     Check if the object causes blinking (i.e. a constant on/off
                     behavior of part of the screen) that does not stop and that cannot be stopped by the website
                     visitor.
                     	 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     If so, modify the object behavior so that no blinking occurs, or so
                     that the visitor has the means to stop it from blinking. Alternatively
                     ,set the object to blink a couple of times and then come to 
                     rest. 
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
               </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td colspan="2" class="clearseparation">&nbsp;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td colspan="2" class="clearseparation">&nbsp;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td valign="top" colspan="2" class="description"><b>Issue Explanation</b><br>
                  
                  <p>
                     The object (script, applet, HTML objects) causes blinking and 
                     the user of the browser will in no way be able to stop this on/off behavior.
                     	 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     This blinking behavior is very distracting to the eye, and will make
                     it very difficult to concentrate on the task of reading the
                     information in the page or in filling in the form contained in the
                     page. 
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     The consequences will be even more significant on users that suffer
                     from cognitive disorders, as they will have a very hard time
                     concentrating on the page content. Consider also users of screen
                     magnifiers, who may read a small portion of the page that overlaps
                     with the blinking text. In these cases, a large part of the magnified
                     screen will blink; again making it very hard for these users to
                     concentrate on the task.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                     Consider that, in a sense, everyone is cognitively disabled
                     when under stress. For example, when buying an e-ticket for a flight from a
                     kiosk in a very noisy and crowded airport, with a long line of
                     people waiting for the same kiosk, most people will be unable to
                     fully concentrate on the task. A blinking element in the page will not
                     help the user to complete the purchase.
                     
                  </p>

            </tr>
