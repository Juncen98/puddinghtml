      <p>I know, you must be saying to yourself: &quot;Sure, 'Senior Rubber Chicken' 
        <i>sounds</i> like an impressive, powerful position, but I bet it's just 
        a fluff job.&quot; Well, you'd be <i>wrong</i>! My many duties include:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p> <a href="http://www.dreamcentral.com/foghorn/process_mgmt.html" target=""><i>Engineering 
          process management.</i></a> I enforce consistency among the one-hundred-odd 
          development engineers by acting as a physical arbitrator during source-code 
          submission. </p>
        <p><a href="http://www.dreamcentral.com/foghorn/stress_reduction.html" target=""><i>Stress 
          management and reduction.</i></a> I promote a healthy office environment 
          by offering myself as a tangible target for normal everyday workplace 
          violence and tension.</p>
        <p><a href="http://www.dreamcentral.com/foghorn/team_meeting.html" target=""><i>Team 
          meeting facilitation.</i></a> I ensure that our meetings stick to their 
          agenda, and that everyone walks away with a set of specific action items.</p>

      <p>Here are some other <b>Frequently Asked Questions</b> (FAQs) about me:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><b>Q:</b> <i>Is the Dreamweaver development team really as fast, loose, 
          and out of control as the many movies, tell-all biographies, and celebrity 
          interviews about them seem to indicate?</i><br>
          <b>A:</b> Well, I can't say too much about that while the various legal 
          cases are still pending, but I <i>can</i> tell you that our weekly expenditures 
          for &quot;novelty&quot; items regularly run in the thousands of dollars.</p>
        <p><b>Q:</b> <i>What do you think of other Macromedia products?<br>
          </i><b>A:</b> They rock! Buy them in bulk packages of one thousand or 
          more!</p>
        <p><b>Q:</b> <i>In an increasingly wetware-centric virtual reality, creme-de-la-creme 
          webmasters will become Way New Information Guerillas, appropriating 
          and recontextualizing content and grabbing mind- and eye-share for the 
          next millenium. Will Dreamweaver lead this glorious revolution?</i><br>
          <b>A:</b> Who are you, Louis Rossetto?</p>
        <p><b>Q:</b> <i>What's the content model for <code>&lt;SPAN&gt;</code>?<br>
          </i><b>A:</b> Processed meat, mostly. Oh, you said <code><i>&lt;SPAN&gt;</i></code>. 
          Uh, I dunno, you'll have to ask Ben. He should be in around 2 am.</p>
        <p><b>Q:</b> <i>Have you been working on any special projects recently?<br>
          </i><b>A:</b> Funny you should ask... I've just been featured in a photo 
          essay entitled <a href="http://www.dreamcentral.com/foghorn/fly.html" target="">&quot;Foghorn 
          Takes Flight&quot;</a>, and I&nbsp;do believe I have a future in film.</p>
        <p><b>Q:</b> <i>Did you know that the white leghorn is genetically engineered 
          to be the perfect chicken for frying?<br>
          </i><b>A:</b> Uh...next question.</p>
        <p><b>Q:</b> <i>No, you don't understand! The <b>white leghorn</b>! It's 
          <b>genetically engineered</b>! For <b>frying</b>! It's <b>perfect!<br>
          </b></i><b>A:</b> That's really great. GUARDS!</p>
        <p><b>Q:</b> <i>Does anyone else on the team have a home page as cool 
          as yours?<br>
          </i><b>A:</b> Of course not, but you can check out their puny attempts 
          at <a href="http://www.dreamcentral.com/">www.dreamcentral.com</a> anyway.</p>
        <p><b></b></p>
        <p><b>Q:</b> <i>Shouldn't you have a funny Southern accent?<br>
          </i><b>A:</b> You must be thinking of someone else.</p>
